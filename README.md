# R shiny and electron

This is a work in progress template for R shiny and electron integration

## Quickstart

* Clone
* `npm install`
* Put a copy of your mac R version in a directory called `r-mac`. The content to copy is here (if you used the official installer): `/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources` (you might want to leave the prune the library folder)
* `npm start`
